topcoat-plugin
==============

This is a plugin that adds the Topcoat.io CSS to your project. Currently adds Topcat 0.7.5.

You can use this to pull topcoat into your Cordova application like so:

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/mooreds/topcoat-plugin

and then add this line to your index.html file:

     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="topcoat/css/topcoat-mobile-light.min.css" />

and then use any of the topcoat classnames on your elements, as demoed here: http://topcoat.io/topcoat/topcoat-mobile-light.html

Note that you won't see any of these classes if you work out of `www`.
